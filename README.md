# fizz-buzz

For me to practice the a Fizz Buzz challenge.
Rules - 

Fizz Buzz challenge - 
ask the user  to input any random number
for every number that is divisible by 3 show the message {Fizz} 
for every number that is divisible by 5 show the message {Buzz}
for every number that is divisible by  3 and 5, show the message {FizzBuzz}

My initial run of this didnt count up to the number input by the user. I re-did the challenge to include that. 

I then re-did the loop again as a recursive loop in order to practice recursion. 

I added in a little bit of bootstrap for slightly better look. 

I added in a secondary recursion to catch negative numbers. 

I added in the parseInt() function in order to catch any decimals that might be input. 

Check out the finished version here!
